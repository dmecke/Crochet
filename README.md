<h1 align="center">v0.1.0 (ALPHA)</h1>

Crochet is a node-based dialogue editor forked from [YarnEditor](https://github.com/YarnSpinnerTool/YarnEditor). It is designed to output Yarn files using Yarn Script (specifically the upcoming 2.0 specification), a narrative scripting language for writing interactive dialogue in games. Yarn Script has been used in games such as [A Short Hike](https://adamgryu.itch.io/a-short-hike), [Far From Noise](https://www.georgebatchelor.com/farfromnoise), [Knights and Bikes](https://foamswordgames.com/#knights), and [Night In The Woods](http://www.nightinthewoods.com/). The Yarn language is designed to be simple and easy to understand, even if you don't have any programming experience. This makes it a great tool for both writers and programmers alike.

The 2.0 specification is currently in flux, which means that Crochet is also in flux and will remain in an alpha state until the specification is pinned down. You can read more about the new specification and keep up to date [here](https://github.com/YarnSpinnerTool/YarnSpinner/blob/yarn-spec/Documentation/Yarn-Spec.md) and [here](https://github.com/YarnSpinnerTool/YarnSpinner/pull/285).

# Yarn Implementations
An implementation or runtime is a library that allows your game engine to parse the files that Crochet creates. Some implementations for game engines are listed below:

- [YarnSpinner](https://github.com/YarnSpinnerTool/YarnSpinner)<br>
A C# implementation created by the original team behind Yarn. It's a very popular choice for Unity devs, but it can be used by any other C# engine.

- [Chatterbox](https://github.com/JujuAdams/Chatterbox)<br>
A Yarn implementation for GameMaker Studio 2.3+ created by [JuJuAdams](http://www.jujuadams.com/).

If you are working on an implementation/runtime and you'd like to be added to this list just open an issue and I'll get it added!
